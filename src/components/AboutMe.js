      <p className='text-textBase'>I am curently a computer science student. I like to expand my skills and learn new things. I also like to design UIs and work with Linux machines to make them look and function better. My interests range from software to philosophy â€” I am interested in the privacy and security of the applications we use in our day-to-day.</p>
      <p className='text-textBase'>Most of my free time involves studying various subjects related to computer science or its subfields. I also work on several unreleased projects (mobile apps, Linux scripts, etc.) and contribute in privacy oriented communities in form of moderation and providing information.</p>
